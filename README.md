# forex_market_info

This repo contains a python script that can help one analyze the forex market. 
After cleaning the dataframe and formatting it to what seemed easiest for me, I wanted to see
what correlations there may be between countries and their currencies.

Currently Included:
  - Python script analyzing the Forex market data from a dataset found on Kaggle.com
  - Quick and easy functions to create plots of the data for visual aid and understanding
  
Will continue with adding:
  - Python script to identify patterns within the market 
  - Prediction model for market (not expecting it to be super accurate)
